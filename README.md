# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
- Maria has came to us with the need for help in an analysis she is doing for the school District. There has been some suspicion of cheating or dishonesty among the 9th graders in Thomas High School. Due to this suspicion Maria has ask us to delete the THS 9th graders from the analysis to ensure that she is providing accurate data to the district when she presents her findings. Along with Pandas, we will be using various python liberties to aid Maria in this project.
